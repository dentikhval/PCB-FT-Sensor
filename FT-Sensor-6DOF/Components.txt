Simple parts:

DAQ Board: 
All resistors: SMD 0805, choose a value of the following:
220 Ohm, 330 Ohm, 470 Ohm, or 1k Ohm

Capacitors: 0.1 uf SMD 0805 for signal lines, 10 uf SMD 1812 for power input

Diodes (at power input): SMD 1206, low drop (Schottky)

Inductance (at 3.3V line after always-on buck converter): just put a jumper or use a very low value, like  1 uH suitable for 900mA or more

Base Board: using example of Side 3 , and expand the same to other sides. In addition to the components listed above.
All resistors SMD 0805
R4, R5, R11, R12: 100R 1% or better - affects read values!
C2, C5: 1nF - higher value gives more stable reading, but increased lag
If you want to fine-tune the readings, it is best to calculate the resistor-capacitor

R13: 20k
R14: 8.2k (R13 and R14 form the resistor divider for feedback voltage control)
R1: 10k (pull-up for 10k thermistor)
R2: 330R DATA rate Digital pull-up
R3: 10k NTC thermistor

Capacitors SMD 0805:
C1, C3, C4, C6: 100nF filter caps
C8, C9: 10uF for power filtering
